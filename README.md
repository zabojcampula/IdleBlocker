# IdleBlocker

IdleBlocker is a simple utility for MS Windows that prevent computer to sleep or lock.

This program attempts to prevent the computer from locking, turning off the screen,
or going to sleep, even if it is set to do so automatically based on its configuration.
You might wonder why this is useful and suggest configuring the computer as needed.
However, anyone who has worked in a corporate environment knows that company security
policies are quite strict, and regular users cannot change them. Since corporate security
experts tend to be paranoid and inflexible (even if they don't know the difference between
SHA-1 and SHA-256), they might set the computer to lock after just 5 minutes of inactivity.
So, even when I'm working from home alone and go to get a coffee, my computer locks.
This utility can prevent that from happening.
